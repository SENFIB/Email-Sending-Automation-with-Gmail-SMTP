This Python script automates the process of collecting email addresses, managing email lists, and sending personalized emails to recipients using Gmail's SMTP service. The script allows users to input their Gmail credentials (email address and app-specific password), customize the email subject and body, and send mass emails to a list of recipients. Ideal for small-scale email campaigns, this tool supports email list management and batch processing.
